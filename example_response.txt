Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.

If such an agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to &quot;Yes&quot;, regardless of if/when the agreement goes into effect.

Agreements that include the United States and Iran as parties, even if they also involve other countries (e.g., a multilateral deal like the JCPOA), will qualify for resolution.

The primary resolution source for this market will be an official announcement by the United States and/or the Islamic Republic of Iran, however an overwhelming consensus of credible reporting confirming an agreement has been reached will also qualify."/><meta property="fc:frame" content="vNext"/><meta property="fc:frame:image:aspect_ratio" content="1.91:1"/><meta property="fc:frame:image"
